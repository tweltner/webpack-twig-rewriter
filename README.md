npm i -D git+ssh://git@github.com:tweltner/webpack-twig-rewriter.git#v1.0.1
```

### Execute via CLI

Then use ist for example in `package.json` as script.

{
  "name": "your-project",
  "scripts": {
    "webpack-rewrite": "npx twig-rewriter ./templates/index.html.twig -m ./dist/manifest.json -o ./dist/index.html.twig"
  }
}
```

### Prepare Twig-Template

Add placeholders to replace in your HTML file. Use keys from `manifest.json` generated by webpack to map resources correctly to given placeholders.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My website</title>

    <link
      href="my/path/<%= webpack:app.css %>"
      type="text/css"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script
      defer
      type="text/javascript"
